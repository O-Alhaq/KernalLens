# KernelLens

KernelLens is a real-time eBPF-based telemetry framework for hybrid host and network threat detection.

## Current Milestone
M2 - Basic eBPF Event Pipeline

The C XDP program sends packet events through a BPF ring buffer to a C
libbpf agent. Every packet returns `XDP_PASS`, including when the ring buffer
is full (in that case the event is skipped). No packet parsing or detection is
performed.

Prerequisites: Linux with BTF, BPF ring buffers and XDP BPF-link support,
Clang/LLVM with the BPF target, libbpf development headers, bpftool, pkg-config,
Make and a C compiler. The existing `ebpf/include/vmlinux.h` supplies kernel
types for the CO-RE build; the target kernel must expose BTF.

## Build
```bash
make
```

This builds `build/xdp_test.bpf.o`, generates `build/xdp_test.skel.h`, and links
`build/kernellens-agent`. `make clean` removes generated build files.

Run on a selected interface with BPF/network administration privileges:

```bash
sudo ./build/kernellens-agent INTERFACE
```

The agent uses a native XDP BPF link and refuses conflicting attachments.
The selected interface/driver must support this attachment mode. It prints
`timestamp=... ifindex=... packet_length=...` for ingress packets. Timestamp
is monotonic nanoseconds since boot; packet length is the XDP packet length
in bytes, including the Ethernet header. Press Ctrl-C or send SIGTERM to
detach and exit. The unpinned link is also released if the process exits
unexpectedly.

Run the integration test after building:

```bash
sudo make test
```

The test requires `ip`, `ping`, `unshare`, `nsenter`, and `timeout`. It creates a veth pair
between temporary network namespaces, confirms ping delivery and printed events,
checks attachment conflict handling and signal cleanup, then destroys the
namespace. It does not attach to the host's active interfaces.
